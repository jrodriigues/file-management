# File management programs written in python

### fileNameChanger.py - #### This program is intended to quickly rename all the files within a specified directory while keeping the same extension.
#### When you run the program, you will be prompted 3 things:
1. The absolute path of the directory where your files are
2. The file type (it will only modify one type of file per run)
3. The new file name base

#### So far I have only added the options for image/video file types, but more types can be added easily.
